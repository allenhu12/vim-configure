# Project Requirements Document: Release Repository Profile Management

## Project Overview

Enhance the git_sh1.sh script to support multiple repository configurations through a profile-based system, enabling management of different software releases and AP types without manual script modifications.

## Business Problem

The current git_sh1.sh script has hardcoded repository mappings, making it difficult to:
- Work with different software releases (unleashed_200.19, unleashed_200.20, etc.)
- Manage various AP configurations (openwrt_common, openwrt_r370, buildroot)
- Switch between different repository sets efficiently
- Maintain consistency across different development environments

## Project Goals

### Primary Objectives
1. **Dynamic Repository Configuration**: Replace hardcoded repo_map with profile-based system
2. **Multi-Release Support**: Enable concurrent work on different software releases
3. **Configuration Flexibility**: Support various AP types and custom configurations
4. **Workflow Integration**: Seamlessly integrate with existing git_sh1.sh commands

### Success Criteria
- Create profiles from manifest.xml files automatically
- Switch between repository configurations without script modification
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing workflows
- Support profile inheritance and migration between releases

## Functional Requirements

### Core Features

#### FR-1: Profile Creation and Management
- **FR-1.1**: Create profiles from manifest.xml files
- **FR-1.2**: Generate repo_map.txt automatically from manifests
- **FR-1.3**: Store profile metadata (creation date, repository count, etc.)
- **FR-1.4**: List available profiles with release grouping
- **FR-1.5**: Display profile details and repository mappings

#### FR-2: Command Integration
- **FR-2.1**: Add `--profile` parameter to existing commands
- **FR-2.2**: Support profile specification in fetch operations
- **FR-2.3**: Enable profile-aware worktree creation
- **FR-2.4**: Integrate profiles with feature management commands

#### FR-3: Worktree Profile Association
- **FR-3.1**: Associate profiles with worktrees during creation
- **FR-3.2**: Automatically detect profiles from worktree context
- **FR-3.3**: Allow profile override with explicit specification
- **FR-3.4**: Display current profile in worktree status

#### FR-4: Release Management
- **FR-4.1**: Organize profiles hierarchically by release
- **FR-4.2**: Support profile inheritance between releases
- **FR-4.3**: Provide migration tools for new releases
- **FR-4.4**: Compare profiles across releases

### Advanced Features

#### FR-5: Profile Inheritance System
- **FR-5.1**: Define base profiles for common configurations
- **FR-5.2**: Create variant profiles with modifications
- **FR-5.3**: Support cross-release inheritance
- **FR-5.4**: Validate inheritance chains

#### FR-6: Migration and Comparison Tools
- **FR-6.1**: Migrate profiles between releases
- **FR-6.2**: Show differences between profiles
- **FR-6.3**: Detect repository changes across releases
- **FR-6.4**: Suggest migration strategies

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance Requirements
- **NFR-1**: Profile loading must complete within 500ms
- **NFR-2**: Manifest parsing should handle files up to 1MB
- **NFR-3**: Profile operations should not impact existing command performance

### Reliability Requirements
- **NFR-4**: System must gracefully handle corrupted manifest files
- **NFR-5**: Profile operations must be atomic (all-or-nothing)
- **NFR-6**: System must maintain data integrity during concurrent access

### Usability Requirements
- **NFR-7**: Error messages must provide clear resolution guidance
- **NFR-8**: Profile names must follow consistent naming conventions
- **NFR-9**: System must maintain backward compatibility with existing scripts

### Maintainability Requirements
- **NFR-10**: Profile data must be human-readable and editable
- **NFR-11**: System must support easy addition of new profile types
- **NFR-12**: Code changes must follow existing script patterns and conventions

## Technical Constraints

### Platform Constraints
- Must work on Linux, macOS, and Windows (where git_sh1.sh currently works)
- Must use only tools available in standard shell environments
- Must maintain compatibility with existing git_sh1.sh architecture

### Data Constraints
- Profile names must be filesystem-safe
- Manifest files must be valid XML
- Repository paths must follow git-depot conventions

### Integration Constraints
- Must not break existing git_sh1.sh functionality
- Must integrate with existing feature management system
- Must work with current worktree and repository structures

## User Stories

### As a Developer
- I want to create profiles from manifest files so I can work with different repository configurations
- I want to switch between profiles easily so I can work on different releases simultaneously
- I want the system to remember which profile I'm using so I don't have to specify it repeatedly

### As a Build Engineer
- I want to create new release profiles based on existing ones so I can efficiently manage configuration evolution
- I want to compare profiles across releases so I can understand what changed
- I want to validate profile configurations so I can catch errors early

### As a Team Lead
- I want consistent profile naming so team members can easily understand configurations
- I want profile inheritance so we can maintain common configurations efficiently
- I want migration tools so we can smoothly transition between releases

## Dependencies

### Internal Dependencies
- Existing git_sh1.sh script functionality
- Current repository and worktree structure
- Existing feature management system

### External Dependencies
- XML parsing tools (xmllint or equivalent)
- Standard POSIX shell utilities
- Git version control system

## Risks and Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Risk**: Profile corruption affecting workflow
- **Mitigation**: Atomic operations and validation checks

- **Risk**: Performance impact on large repositories
- **Mitigation**: Caching and lazy loading strategies

### Process Risks
- **Risk**: User confusion with new profile system
- **Mitigation**: Clear documentation and gradual rollout

- **Risk**: Backward compatibility issues
- **Mitigation**: Extensive testing and fallback mechanisms

## Acceptance Criteria

### Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
1. Create profiles from manifest.xml files
2. Use profiles in fetch operations
3. Associate profiles with worktrees
4. List and display profile information

### Full Feature Set
1. Complete command integration with all git_sh1.sh functions
2. Profile inheritance and migration tools
3. Advanced profile management features
4. Comprehensive error handling and validation

## Timeline and Milestones

The project will be implemented in 5 phases as detailed in the development plan, with each phase delivering a working MVP that adds value while maintaining system stability.
