# Project Requirements Document: Divide git_sh1.sh

## Project Objective
Refactor the monolithic git_sh1.sh script (3200+ lines) into a modular, maintainable, and testable set of bash modules while preserving all existing functionality and maintaining backward compatibility.

## Background
The current git_sh1.sh script manages complex git repository workflows including:
- Multi-repository management
- Worktree operations
- Feature branch workflows
- Profile-based configurations
- Manifest parsing

The script has grown organically and now requires modularization for better maintainability.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
1. **Preserve All Functionality**
   - All existing commands must work identically
   - All existing options and parameters must be supported
   - All error messages and output formatting must remain consistent

2. **Maintain API Compatibility**
   - Existing command line interface must remain unchanged
   - All bash completion functionality must be preserved
   - Environment variables and configuration files must work as before

3. **Modular Architecture**
   - Split into logical, cohesive modules
   - Clear separation of concerns
   - Well-defined interfaces between modules
   - Independent testability of each module

### Non-Functional Requirements
1. **Maintainability**
   - Each module should be < 500 lines
   - Clear function naming and documentation
   - Consistent error handling patterns
   - Reduced code duplication

2. **Performance**
   - No performance regression
   - Startup time must remain < 1 second
   - Memory usage should not increase significantly

3. **Reliability**
   - All existing safety mechanisms must be preserved
   - Path validation and input sanitization must be maintained
   - Process locking and cleanup must work as before

4. **Testability**
   - Each module must be unit testable
   - Mock interfaces for external dependencies
   - Integration test coverage for critical workflows

## Scope

### In Scope
1. Modularize the git_sh1.sh script into separate files
2. Create a module loader/orchestrator
3. Maintain all existing functionality
4. Preserve backward compatibility
5. Add basic unit test structure
6. Update documentation

### Out of Scope
1. Adding new features or functionality
2. Changing the command line interface
3. Rewriting in other languages
4. Performance optimizations beyond modularization
5. UI/UX improvements

## Success Criteria
1. All existing tests pass (if any)
2. All commands work identically to original script
3. Modular structure with < 500 lines per module
4. No performance regression
5. Basic unit tests for core modules
6. Updated documentation reflecting new structure

## Constraints
1. Must remain in bash/shell script
2. Must work on existing target systems
3. Cannot break existing workflows or scripts that depend on git_sh1.sh
4. Must maintain all security safeguards

## Deliverables
1. Modularized git_sh1.sh split into logical components
2. Module loader/main entry point
3. Updated documentation
4. Basic test suite structure
5. Migration guide
6. Backward compatibility verification

## Assumptions
1. The current script works correctly in target environment
2. No major changes to underlying git workflows are needed
3. Existing users will not need to change their usage patterns
4. Development environment supports bash scripting and testing
