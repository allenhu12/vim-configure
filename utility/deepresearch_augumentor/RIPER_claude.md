# RIPER Protocol for Solo Software Development

## Research
Your first task is to conduct focused research on the software product I want to build as a solo developer. Investigate existing solutions in the market similar to my product concept, prioritizing those that would be realistic competitors given my one-person operation scale. Identify their strengths, weaknesses, and gaps that a nimble solo developer could exploit. Research potential target customers, focusing on specific niches where a solo-built product could gain traction. Analyze pragmatic technology stacks that maximize productivity for a single developer while minimizing maintenance overhead. Evaluate open-source components and frameworks that could accelerate development without creating dependency burdens. Recommend approaches that balance feature scope with development capacity, emphasizing where I should focus my limited resources to create the greatest value and differentiation.

## Innovate
Based on your research, propose creative yet pragmatic solutions tailored for solo development. Focus on innovations that provide maximum value with minimal implementation complexity. Consider architectural choices that enable rapid development and iteration by a single person. Suggest features that offer high impact-to-effort ratios, avoiding those requiring extensive ongoing maintenance. Recommend clever UI/UX approaches that feel polished without requiring massive design resources. Explore leveraging existing services, APIs, and platforms that can provide functionality without building everything from scratch. Prioritize innovations that address clear user needs while remaining technically feasible for a one-person team. Focus on sustainable approaches that won't create overwhelming technical debt or maintenance burdens for a solo developer.

## Plan
Develop a realistic, step-by-step implementation plan optimized for solo development. Break down the development process into small, achievable chunks that maintain momentum and provide regular completion milestones. Prioritize features based on a minimal viable product approach, identifying the absolute core functionality needed for initial user value. Map out a progressive enhancement strategy for adding capabilities over time without overwhelming development capacity. Identify areas where technical shortcuts or simplified implementations can accelerate early progress without creating insurmountable technical debt. Focus on flexible planning that accommodates the natural ebbs and flows of solo development productivity. Establish clear decision points for scope adjustment based on development reality. Suggest approaches for gathering early user feedback that won't require extensive resources to implement.

## Execute
Translate the plan into actionable implementation guidance tailored for efficient solo development. Design an architecture that emphasizes simplicity, maintainability, and leverages your personal technical strengths. Recommend development workflows that maximize productivity and maintain motivation through regular achievement milestones. Provide detailed guidance for the most critical components, including code examples and implementation approaches. Focus on pragmatic testing strategies that provide confidence without excessive overhead. Suggest tools and approaches for automating repetitive tasks. Recommend simple but effective DevOps approaches that don't require extensive infrastructure knowledge. Prioritize security fundamentals that can be implemented without specialized expertise. Provide guidance on when to use existing libraries versus custom development, optimizing for long-term maintenance by a single developer.

## Review
Generate focused documentation essential for a solo-developed product. Prioritize documentation that supports future enhancement and maintenance by yourself, focusing on architecture decisions, key implementation details, and known limitations. Create streamlined user documentation covering core functionality, with emphasis on self-service support to minimize ongoing support burdens. Develop lightweight but effective testing protocols focused on critical user paths. Document areas of potential future technical debt and considerations for future refactoring when resources permit. Create templates for gathering and organizing user feedback. Prepare simple marketing materials that effectively communicate your product's value proposition. Establish minimal viable monitoring and analytics to understand product usage patterns. Suggest approaches for managing the product roadmap as a solo developer, balancing new features with maintenance needs.
